			<h2> On August 12, 1994, a 22-year-old
                Christian von Koenigsegg decided to
                follow his dream and build the world's
                greatest sports car. Koenigsegg
                Automotive is born.</h2> 
			<p>A supercar  also called exotic car is loosely defined or described as a street-legal, superlative performance sports car â€“ both in terms of power, speed, and handling. The term 'supercar' is therefore frequently used for low-bodied sportscars with powerful, rear mid-mounted engines.[1] Since the 2000s, the term hypercar has also come into use for the most high-end performance cars.
